Implementation of some basic Deep Learning algorithms using PyTorch

This repository contains implementations of some basic deep learning algorithms. The various files have the following methods implemented:

mnistspy.py: A simple feed-forward network to classify digits in the MNIST dataset implemented from scratch (without PyTorch). Reaches accuracy of 97% on the test data.
mnistcnn.py: Implementation of convolutional neural network from scratch to classify digits in MNIST dataset. Reaches an accuracy of ~95% on test data.
cifar10cnn.py: Implementation of CNN using Pytorch to classify objects in CIFAR10 dataset.
cifar100resnet.py: Implementation of Residual neural network using Pytorch to classify objects in CIFAR100 dataset.
